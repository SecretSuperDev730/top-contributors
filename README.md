# Top Contributors
This is a simple application (NextJS) fetching the topmost contributors of the Angular GitHub repository in a
scrollable-paginated list.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the git repository
### 2. Install dependencies

It is encouraged to use **yarn** so the husky hooks can work properly.

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`.

### 4. Run unit tests

You can run unit tests using this command:

```bash
yarn test
```
